# Apex-Wizard
Repo for CS game dev 



For Github Dev Pipeline:
Each scene in game will have its own branch for development. All testing and initial code commits should be done in these branches. 
Once done, each team member will pull request and check code. Once code has been approved, then merge into main.

As more scenes are created, then create the associated branch for it on Github. Once scene has been completed, then merge branch into main. 

Refer to Trello board for all associated tasks and sprints. Order for tasks is as follows: Product backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> in progress -> testing -> done.

Most art will be original creations.
